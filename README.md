# skeletal-sex-estimation
A GNU Octave function for skeletal sex estimation

The function estimate_sex comprises a self-intuitive graphical user interface for estimating sex from the femur, tibia, and humerus. The available “long_bone_classifier.mat” contains all relevant classification parameters based on modern Greek reference skeletal collection known as the Athens Collection. A testing dataset “sampledata.csv” containing all relevant measurements from three long bones of one male and one female individual from the Athens Collection is also bundled with the function for demonstrating purposes.
